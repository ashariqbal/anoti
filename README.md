# Installation
anoti uses the following stacks and services

* [twilio](www.twilio.com) to send SMS
* [zohomail](www.zoho.com) to serve emails
* [digitalocean](www.digitalocean.com) for cloud computing platform and DNS
* [sqlite3](www.sqlite3.org) database to store orders
* [docker](www.docker.com) to containerize multiple instances of the application

If any of this is a foreign language to you, you most likely need a developer's
help getting all of this setup. Reach me directly @tchoedak <tchoedak@gmail.com>
to get my services in setting this all up.
