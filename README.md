# Installation
anoti uses the following stacks and services

* twilio to send SMS
* zohomail to serve emails
* digitalocean for cloud computing platform and DNS
* sqlite3 database to store orders
* docker to containerize multiple instances of the application

If any of this is a foreign language to you, you most likely need a developer's
help getting all of this setup. Reach me directly @tchoedak <tchoedak@gmail.com>
to get my services in setting this all up.
